# Milestone 1: Basic Evidence Ingestion and Situation Feed

## Overview
Establish the core data flow for syftly.ai by implementing basic evidence ingestion from news sources and enabling a functional situation feed. This milestone focuses on validating the foundational primitives (Evidence, Situation, Change) with real or mocked data, ensuring the system can ingest news content, cluster it into situations, and display meaningful changes. It aligns with the architecture blueprint's "What to Code First" priorities (Evidence ingestion → Situation creation → Change object creation → Read-only feed) while keeping scope minimal to avoid premature complexity.

## Goals
- Demonstrate end-to-end data flow from external news sources to user-facing feed.
- Validate the five core primitives in a working system.
- Provide a foundation for iterative development and testing of change detection logic.
- Enable basic user interaction with situations and changes (read-only).

## Objectives
- **Evidence Ingestion**: Set up polling for 1-2 news sources to fetch and store raw articles as Evidence records.
- **Situation Matching**: Implement rule-based creation of situations from ingested evidence.
- **Change Proposal**: Stub in change evaluation logic to simulate meaningful updates.
- **Feed Functionality**: Ensure frontend/backend can display situations and changes in a simple view.
- **Documentation**: Populate this file with milestone details and update daily logs.

## Scope and Limitations
- **In Scope**: Ingestion of ~10-20 articles, creation of 2-3 situations, simulation of 1-2 changes. Basic rule-based heuristics for situation clustering (e.g., keyword matching). Simple list/timeline view for feed. No AI/LLM integration, user authentication, complex UI (e.g., chat), or production-ready error handling.
- **Out of Scope**: Full AI for interpretation/projection, multiple sources, advanced clustering, user auth, mobile support, social features, monetization, or performance optimizations.
- **Constraints**: Use existing schemas and routes; prioritize simplicity over sophistication. Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks for a solo developer.

## Technical Implementation
### Backend Tasks
1. **Evidence Ingestion Service**:
   - Add a new service (`/backend/services/evidenceIngestion.js`) to poll RSS feeds from selected sources (e.g., Reuters World News or BBC News).
   - Fetch articles using a library like `rss-parser` (add to package.json if needed).
   - Store as Evidence records: title, body, source, url, publishDate, fetchedAt.
   - Schedule periodic runs (e.g., every 15-30 minutes) using `node-cron`.
   - Handle duplicates (e.g., by URL hash) and basic error handling.

2. **Situation Creation Logic**:
   - Extend situation service (`/backend/services/situationService.js`) to process new Evidence.
   - Implement basic clustering: Group Evidence by keywords/topics (e.g., extract entities like "Venezuela", "election" and match to existing situations or create new ones).
   - For new situations: Initialize with summary, status ("active"), confidence (0.5), keyFacts, and link to Evidence.
   - Update existing situations: Append new Evidence if relevant.

3. **Change Evaluation Stub**:
   - Create a change service (`/backend/services/changeService.js`) to propose changes.
   - For now, implement simple rules: If new Evidence significantly alters keyFacts (e.g., adds new actors), create a Change record with before/after states and reasoning ("New evidence suggests...").
   - Store changes append-only; simulate 1-2 fake changes for testing.

4. **API Enhancements**:
   - Update routes (`/backend/routes/situations.js`, `/backend/routes/feed.js`) to support querying situations with changes and associated Evidence.
   - Add endpoints for feed: e.g., GET `/api/feed` returning list of active situations with recent changes.

### Frontend Tasks
1. **Feed Page**:
   - Create a new page (`/frontend/src/pages/Feed.jsx`) for the situation feed.
   - Display situations as a list or simple timeline: Show summary, status, confidence, recent changes, and linked Evidence (e.g., as clickable titles).
   - Use existing UI components from `/frontend/src/components/ui/` for layout.

2. **API Integration**:
   - Update services (`/frontend/src/services/api.js`) to fetch from new feed endpoints.
   - Add hooks (`/frontend/src/hooks/useFeed.js`) for data fetching and state management.

3. **Navigation Updates**:
   - Update routing in `App.jsx` to include the feed page (e.g., `/feed`).
   - Modify landing page if needed to link to feed after ingestion.

### Infrastructure and Testing
- **Database**: Ensure MongoDB is set up; use existing models. Populate with initial Evidence/Situations for testing.
- **Testing**: Add basic unit tests for new services (e.g., using Jest if configured). Manually test data flow.
- **Linting/Typecheck**: Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` in both backend and frontend after changes.
- **Environment**: Use dev configs; avoid production secrets.

## Deliverables
- Working API endpoints for feed and situations.
- Frontend feed page displaying ingested data.
- 10-20 ingested articles, 2-3 situations, 1-2 simulated changes.
- Updated docs/milestone1 with this content.
- Daily log entry summarizing completion and learnings.
- Commit message: "feat: Implement Milestone 1 - Basic Evidence Ingestion and Situation Feed"

## Success Criteria
- System can ingest news from sources and store as Evidence.
- Situations are created/clustered from Evidence.
- Changes are proposed and linked to situations.
- Users can view a feed of situations with changes and sources via frontend.
- No critical bugs; data flow is reliable for small-scale testing.

## Next Steps (Post-Milestone)
- Refine change detection with heuristics or AI.
- Expand to more sources and complex clustering.
- Add chat interface and timelines.
- Iterate based on user feedback.

## Rationale
This milestone establishes the core loop without over-engineering, allowing early validation of the situation-focused model. It addresses the gap between implemented schemas and functional intelligence, providing a tangible demo while following the PRD's MVP principles. By starting small, we can test assumptions (e.g., situation clustering) and pivot before investing in AI layers.
