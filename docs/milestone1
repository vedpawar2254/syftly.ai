# Milestone 1: Topic-Based News Ingestion and Situation Feed (India Focus)

## Overview
This milestone establishes the foundational flow for syftly.ai: enabling users to type in a topic, automatically scraping multiple India-specific news sources, summarizing the results, and allowing users to follow topics of interest. The goal is to validate the core loop—topic input, evidence ingestion, summarization, and user interaction—while keeping the implementation minimal and focused on the Indian news ecosystem.

## Flow
1. **User types in a topic** (e.g., "Indian elections", "ISRO launches").
2. **System scrapes multiple Indian news sources** for articles relevant to the topic.
3. **Summarization**: The system generates a concise summary of the collected articles.
4. **Situation Feed**: Summaries and supporting articles are displayed in a user-facing feed.
5. **Follow Topic**: Users can choose to follow a topic for future updates.

## Goals
- Demonstrate end-to-end flow from user topic input to a populated situation feed.
- Validate ingestion, summarization, and basic user interaction (topic following).
- Focus on India-specific news sources for initial implementation.

## Objectives
- **Topic-Based Ingestion**: Enable user-driven topic search and fetch relevant news articles from Indian sources.
- **Summarization**: Implement basic summarization (rule-based or extractive) for grouped articles.
- **Situation Feed**: Display summaries and articles in a simple, readable feed.
- **Follow Feature**: Allow users to follow topics (store followed topics per user/session).
- **Documentation**: Update this file with milestone details and daily progress.

## Scope and Limitations
- **In Scope**: Ingestion from 2-3 major Indian news sources (e.g., The Hindu, Times of India, Indian Express), basic keyword/topic matching, simple summarization, minimal UI for feed and follow.
- **Out of Scope**: AI/LLM-based summarization, advanced clustering, user authentication, notifications, production-grade error handling, or mobile support.
- **Constraints**: Use existing schemas where possible; keep logic simple and modular for future expansion.

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Tasks
1. **News Scraper Service**:
   - Create `/backend/services/newsScraper.js` to fetch articles from Indian news sources based on user topic.
   - Use RSS feeds or web scraping (e.g., `rss-parser`, `axios`, `cheerio`).
   - Store articles as Evidence: title, body, source, url, publishDate, fetchedAt, matchedTopic.
   - Deduplicate by URL or title.

2. **Summarization Logic**:
   - Implement a basic summarizer (e.g., extractive: top sentences, or keyword-based summary).
   - Group articles by topic and generate a summary for each group.

3. **Situation Feed API**:
   - Add `/backend/routes/feed.js` endpoint: GET `/api/feed?topic=...` returns summaries and articles for a topic.
   - Add POST `/api/follow` to store followed topics (per user/session).

### Frontend Tasks
1. **Topic Search UI**:
   - Add input for users to type a topic (e.g., `/frontend/src/pages/Feed.jsx`).
   - Trigger backend fetch on submit.

2. **Feed Display**:
   - Show summaries and supporting articles in a list/timeline.
   - Allow users to click to view full articles.

3. **Follow Button**:
   - Add a button to follow the current topic; persist in frontend state and backend.

4. **Navigation**:
   - Update routing to include the feed and followed topics.

### Infrastructure and Testing
- **Database**: Use MongoDB for storing Evidence, summaries, and followed topics.
- **Testing**: Add basic unit tests for scraper and summarizer. Manual end-to-end test of the flow.
- **Linting/Typecheck**: Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` in both backend and frontend.
- **Environment**: Use dev configs; avoid production secrets.

## Deliverables
- Working topic-based news ingestion and summarization flow.
- Feed page displaying summaries and articles for user-entered topics.
- Follow feature for topics.
- Ingestion from at least 2 Indian news sources.
- Updated docs/milestone1 with this content.
- Daily log entry summarizing completion and learnings.
- Commit message: "feat: Implement Milestone 1 - Topic-Based News Ingestion and Situation Feed (India)"

## Success Criteria
- User can enter a topic and see a feed of summarized news from Indian sources.
- Summaries and articles are grouped by topic.
- User can follow a topic for future updates.
- No critical bugs; flow works reliably for small-scale testing.

## Next Steps (Post-Milestone)
- Improve summarization with AI/LLM.
- Expand to more sources and languages.
- Add notifications and richer user profiles.
- Iterate UI/UX based on feedback.

## Rationale
This milestone delivers a tangible, India-focused demo of syftly.ai's core value: surfacing and summarizing news situations by topic. It validates the ingestion and summarization loop, sets up the foundation for more advanced features, and ensures early feedback from real user flows.
