# CORE PROBLEM:
    - News no longer preserves a stable understanding of reality.


# Setup base

1. Rethink very very carefully about the new user Experience when consuming newss and optimize for low effort, high signal for the user.
2. Internationalization of the news - pull from local news sources and translate them to English.
3. Idenify Biases




# UX rethinking


## Problems

Volume > signal
Headlines without context
News is fragmented
     No canonical “what we know so far”
Emotion-first, agency-last
     Almost no distinction between impact levels
     Fear and anger are amplified
Personalisation problem
Language barrier




- an ai agent to consume the news for you and get what you need.

Possible solution directions

- Volume > signal

 - deliberatly choose less amount of things to show - only the deltas
    - Now as to what to show
        - should update the state of understanding of the user
            - track what the user is interested in
            - track what the user is reading
            - track what the user is asking about
        - create a feedback loop to understand if we are serving the right information to the user


- Headlines without context
    
    - Instead of showing the headline, show topics, time, exhaustive title about what changed ( in the form of a story evolution)
    - abstract: give the main points of the whole story
    - show the evolution of the story and the evidences and opinions regarding it in a timeline format
    - Give important information like key actors, key events, key changes, key perspectives, key evidences
    - then a detaileed description of the story who what where when why how
    - takeway
    - connect causal threads, and connect events with each other
        - how: 
        1. Create Template Patterns
            Who – affected groups
            What – directional impact (up/down, increase/decrease)
            When – immediate, near-term, long-term
            Confidence – High / Medium / Low
            Delta triggers – what counts as a meaningful update

        2. Populate Real Events
        3. Detect Potential Causation
            Compare affected groups and impact types across events
            Apply rule-based heuristics:
                Event A occurs before Event B in time
                Event A affects a group relevant to Event B
                Event A’s impact intensity is above threshold

            Optionally: Edge confidence = sum of overlap + magnitude



<!-- - reporter ratings -->
- methodology of journalism used
-  ai agent and users, verify the information
    - add a comment on this for sensative cases




- hyper personalization of catagories

- timeline and causation loop of events

- search
