# syftly.ai — Visual Style Guide (v1)

Scope: **Landing page + Countdown page only**
Goal: *Feels like opening a newspaper — but designed for thinking, not scrolling.*

---

## 1. Design Philosophy (Non‑negotiable)

syftly should feel:

* **Editorial, not techy**
* **Calm, not stimulating**
* **Dense with meaning, sparse with elements**

Mental reference:

> A serious newspaper + modern information design + restraint

Avoid:

* Startup gloss
* SaaS gradients
* Futuristic UI
* Over-animation

---

## 2. Visual Identity Pillars

### Pillar 1 — Hierarchy over decoration

Everything earns its place.
Typography creates structure, not colors or cards.

### Pillar 2 — Silence is part of the design

Whitespace = confidence.
Empty space is intentional.

### Pillar 3 — Text is the hero

Images support ideas.
Typography *is* the interface.

---

## 3. Typography System (Newspaper‑inspired)

### Primary Serif (Headlines)

Used for:

* Hero headline
* Section headers
* Countdown emphasis

**Options (pick one):**

* **Libre Baskerville** (classic, readable, modern)
* **Playfair Display** (more dramatic, use sparingly)
* **Cormorant Garamond** (editorial, refined)

Style:

* Large sizes
* Tight line-height
* Strong contrast

---

### Secondary Serif / Sans (Body & Meta)

Used for:

* Descriptions
* Microcopy
* Countdown labels

**Options:**

* **Inter** (clean, neutral, modern)
* **Source Sans 3** (editorial-friendly)
* **IBM Plex Sans** (quietly technical)

Avoid mixing more than **two font families**.

---

### Typographic Rules

* Headlines can break lines awkwardly — that’s fine
* Never center long paragraphs
* Use italics sparingly (quotes only)
* No all-caps paragraphs

---

## 4. Color System (Print-first)

### Base Palette

* **Ink Black** — #111111
* **Paper White** — #FAF9F7
* **Soft Gray** — #CFCFCF

### Accent (Optional, very restrained)

* Muted rust / deep blue / dark olive
* Used only for:

  * Emphasis
  * Active states
  * Subtle dividers

Rule:

> If color draws attention to itself, remove it.

---

## 5. Layout Principles

### Grid

* Desktop: 8–12 column editorial grid
* Mobile: single column, generous margins

Margins should feel **wasteful**.
This is intentional.

---

### Rhythm

* Large vertical spacing between sections
* Tight spacing within text blocks

Creates the feeling of *chapters*, not cards.

---

## 6. Hero Section (Landing Page)

### Composition

* Large serif headline
* Minimal supporting sentence (1 line max)
* Hero animation sits *behind or below* text

Text should feel like a newspaper front page headline.

No buttons competing for attention.

---

## 7. Countdown Page Style

This page should feel like:

> A printing press waiting to start

### Typography

* Countdown numbers: large, serif
* Labels: small, understated sans

### Copy tone

* Calm
* Matter-of-fact
* Slightly mysterious

Examples of microcopy tone:

* “Awaiting first signal”
* “No updates until something changes”

---

## 8. Motion & Interaction

Motion rules:

* Slow
* Purposeful
* Mostly opacity and position

Avoid:

* Bouncy easing
* Parallax everywhere
* Continuous motion

Hero animation scroll = **subtraction**, not addition.

---

## 9. UI Elements (Minimal Set)

Allowed:

* Thin dividers
* Simple text links
* One primary CTA max

Avoid:

* Cards
* Shadows
* Pills
* Badges

---

## 10. What This Style Signals (Important)

To users:

* This product values thinking
* This product respects attention
* This product is not chasing trends

To recruiters / engineers:

* Taste
* Restraint
* Product judgment

---

## 11. Future Compatibility

This style system will later extend naturally to:

* Timelines
* Change diffs
* Comparative views

Without redesign.

That’s the goal.
